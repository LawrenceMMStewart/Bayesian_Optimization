The following Project investigates the use of Bayesian Optimzation to tune Parameters of the XOR Neural Network:

Hopefully should be a lot more smaller now

Contents: where each section is linked to a part of the paper


Future Work Code: THis is the fil
A breif explanation of the temporal XOR and the neural network that is required for modellign this in the same way that elman  published in his paper- finding strucutre in time (cite this aws well) then have a folder with all this work dumped inside (which is the future work)


also cite all improvements for example O(log^2(n)) GP's


Also talk about Betty and Gordon Moore foundation and Mark Stalzer and Caltech
