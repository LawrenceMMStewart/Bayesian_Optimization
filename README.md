Future Work Code: THis is the fil
A breif explanation of the temporal XOR and the neural network that is required for modellign this in the same way that elman  published in his paper- finding strucutre in time (cite this aws well) then have a folder with all this work dumped inside (which is the future work)


also cite all improvements for example O(log^2(n)) GP's
